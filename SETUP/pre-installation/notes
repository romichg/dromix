add romix user to the docker group

copy daemon.json to /etc/docker - this will disable the default bridge network

create networks with createnet script in this directory

NOTE THAT for --extra=ABC in the dromix.sh arguments any spaces in the ABC part (i.e. A B C) must be replaced by __ (two underscores) this is because we have a poors man of parcing arguments
